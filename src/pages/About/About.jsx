          Hey there! I&apos;m Melvin Mangubat, a web developer from Calamba,
          Philippines. After spending a solid two years diving into web
          development through a bootcamp and loads of self-learning, I&apos;m
          all about building cool stuff! ðŸš€
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-slate tracking-wide leading-7">
          During my bootcamp days, I wasn&apos;t just keeping up, I was a top
          student, soaking up all the ins and outs of web development. Now,
          let&apos;s turn those skills into some awesome projects!
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-slate tracking-wide leading-7">
          I&apos;ve got a good handle on front-end design and have dived into
          the backend world too. But for me, it&apos;s not just about the code;
          it&apos;s about creating digital stories. Every project is a chance to
          make something smooth and memorable.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-slate tracking-wide leading-7">
          Let&apos;s not just make apps, let&apos;s make digital spaces that
          people genuinely enjoy. Whether it&apos;s fixing up how things look or
          tweaking behind-the-scenes tech, I&apos;m all about making web stuff
          awesome.
        </p>
